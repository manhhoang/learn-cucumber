# Learn Gradle 

## Running...

You run the application by calling the `com.jd.gradle.web.ExerciseApplication#main`.

You can build a jar file with `gradle build`, then run it with `java -jar build/libs/com.jd.gradle-0.1.0.jar`,
alternatively use `gradle bootRun` to use the spring boot runner (the terminal will hang whilst this runs, stop with `CTRL-C`).

You can see the running application at `http://localhost:8080/hello-world`.
